# Gemini_Digitization_Guide
This repository serves as a guide for John-Eric and Winnie’s pre-docs (as well as anyone else they share it with) on how to use Google’s Gemini API to digitize scanned documents. The process outlined here transforms complex historical documents into structured, usable data files. This README provides step-by-step instructions on how to run and customize the provided template code for any digitization task. The remainder of the document includes an outline with detailed guides and explanatory videos to support this process.
