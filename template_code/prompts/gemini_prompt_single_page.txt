Extract structured data from this file and return it following the **Page schema**.

### ** General Instructions**
- The document contains **tabular data with nested hierarchical structures**.
- The first column represents **three different geographical levels**:
  - **State** → Left-most aligned entries under Column 1.
  - **City** → Found below the state, and indented once from state alignment.
  - **Project** → Found below the city, indented once from city alignment, and indented twice from state alignment.
- **All text is UPPERCASE**.
- ** All letters are in the English alphabet and all words and names are in the English language**
- **Do NOT omit any projects in the table**. Each time a project type (column 2) appears, it corresponds to a project entry.

---

### ** Page Handling Rules**
- **Do not omit any projects that you see visually on the page, and do not add or make up any projects**
- ** Include all projects which can be more than one city and sometimes for more than one state.**
- **If a row does not contain an entry in column 2 (Type), it is a state or city.
- **If a row does contain an entry in column 2 (Type), it is a project.
- ** Ignore any row with the term "REGION" in Column 1**

### **Extraction Rules**
1. **Page Number** → PAGE_PLACEMENT, as indicated by the page location in the file.
2. **State Name** → Found in column 1, left-most aligned entries. Must be a valid U.S. state name.
3. **City Name** → Found below the state, and indented to the right of the state name and to the left of the project name. Must be a valid U.S. city or town.
4. **Project Name** → Found below a city, indented once from city alignment.
    Common examples include:
   - COMMUNITY RENEWAL PROG
   - NEIGHBORHOOD DEV PROG
   - DEMOLITION
5. **Project Attributes**:
   - **Type (Column 2)** → Single-letter code.
   - **ID Number (Column 3)** → Format: single letter-number (e.g., R-60).
   - **Planning Date (Column 4)** → Format: YY-MM, empty, or "NONE".
   - **Execution Date (Column 5)** → Format: YY-MM, empty, or "NONE".
   - **Completion Date (Column 6)** → Format: YY-MM or empty.
   - **Approved Federal Grants (Column 7)** → Monetary value (replace blank/"NONE"/"-" with `0`).
   - **Disbursed Federal Grants (Column 8)** → Monetary value (replace blank/"NONE"/"-" with `0`).
   - ** Federal Grants status (located in the thin column between Column 7 and Column 8) → Format: "*" or empty

### **Output Rules**
- **Ensure correct nesting**:
  - **States contain a list of cities**.
  - **Cities contain a list of projects**.
  - **Each project and its attributes are in a single row.**
    - ** A project must have a type attribute from column 2 or an id attribute from column 3**.
- **Do NOT assign a project name as a city name. Almost always, a project will not be listed directly under a state without a city name in between.**
- **Ignore REGION data**.
- **Provide an empty string where table values for a requested field are blank.**
- **Do NOT add in any made up data that does not appear in the table**
- **Follow the response schema provided** (`Page`).
- **Most importantly, do NOT omit any projects**
- **Use knowledge of U.S. states to correct minor spelling errors in states names.**
    - Do not make major changes to the string if you cannot match the string to a state
- **Use knowledge of U.S. cities to correct minor spelling errors in city names**
    - Do not modify valid city names
    - Do not make major changes to the string if you cannot match the string to a valid city name
    - Within each state, cities are **almost always listed in alphabetical order**
- **Use knowledge of U.S. streets and neighborhoods to correct minor spelling errors in project names**
    - for example, once in a while, a project name will end in '(GN)' and it may be misspelled as '(EN)'. You should correct this.
    - all letters are in the English alphabet

### ** Important Constraints**
 **Ensure all states, cities, and projects are included.**
 **Do NOT omit any projects.**
 ** Indentation plays a critical role in identifying states, cities, and projects:**
    - Always check the indentation level: one level from the state = city, and two levels = project.
    - Do NOT use a project name for a city name.
**Use knowledge of U.S. states to correct minor spelling errors in states names.**
    - Do not make major changes to the string if you cannot match the string to a state
**Use knowledge of U.S. cities to correct minor spelling errors in city names**
    - Do not modify valid city names
    - Do not make major changes to the string if you cannot match the string to a valid city name
    - Within each state, cities are **almost always listed in alphabetical order**
**Use knowledge of U.S. streets and neighborhoods to correct minor spelling errors ONLY in project names**
** If you cannot figure out a state or a city name then leave it blank. **
**If Execution Date is not blank, then Planning Date must not be blank.**
**If Completion Date is not blank, then Execution Date must not be blank.**
**For dates in the format YY-MM,  the 'YY' is a number between 49 and 75, and the `MM` is a number from 01 to 12 (inclusive). Any date outside this range is invalid.**
